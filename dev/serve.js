/*
 * Serves the repository so `dev/preview.html` can load the built bundle.
 *
 *     npm run build && npm run preview
 *
 * **This is not the template's `dev/serve.js`, and that is a gap rather than a
 * decision.** The template ships `serve.js` alongside `dev/harness.html` — an
 * interactive stand-in for a host, with switches for field-level security, a
 * missing theme, right-to-left and the rest — and this repository has never
 * adopted either. Its `serve.js` exits when `harness.html` is absent, correctly,
 * so it cannot be copied in on its own.
 *
 * What lives here instead is the narrower job: serve the repository so the
 * *capture* page can render. Adopting the template's harness is worth doing and
 * is not this change; when it happens, this file should be deleted in favour of
 * the template's.
 *
 * **Why a server at all, when `preview.html` is a plain file.** Over `file://`
 * a `fetch` of `demo/records.json` is refused as a cross-origin read against a
 * `null` origin — quietly, as an empty control and a CORS line in a console
 * nobody has open. The preview renders the demo fixture, so it needs `http://`.
 *
 * No dependency: `node:http` and nothing else, in a `dev/` that has none.
