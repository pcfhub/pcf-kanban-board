 * A virtual (React) dataset control.
 *
 * **What `--type dataset` scaffolds is a table**, with sortable headers, a pager
 * and an open-record button. That is the right default and its comments are the
 * traps a dataset control hits — but a dataset control that is *not* a table
 * replaces most of this file rather than adjusting it. A board, a calendar or a
 * chart keeps the paging and mutator discipline below and little else. Knowing
 * that now is cheaper than discovering it after the manifest is written.
 *
 * Everything that talks to the platform lives in this file. The component never
 * sees `context` or the dataset — every call reaches it as a callback prop.
 * That is not tidiness: it keeps the whole platform surface in one file that
 * can be read against the type definitions in a single pass, which is the only
 * way to be sure about an API this narrow.
 *
 * The rule the rest of this class is shaped by: **`updateView` runs on every
 * change to any bound value, including the ones this control caused itself.**
 * A dataset has mutators — `setPageSize`, `refresh`, `loadNextPage` — and
 * calling any of them unguarded from `updateView` is an infinite loop, not a
 * slow render.
 *
 * The second is why the pager reads none of `hasPreviousPage`, `firstPageNumber`
 * or the raw length of `sortedRecordIds`. Observed on a real model-driven form:
 * `loadNextPage(true)` ignores its argument and returns the whole page range,
 * `hasPreviousPage` stays false so Previous never unlocks, and `firstPageNumber`
 * disagrees with the ids badly enough to print a range past its own total. The
 * page number is this control's own counter, and `currentPage()` cuts the
 * accumulated array back down. Both are commented where they are.
