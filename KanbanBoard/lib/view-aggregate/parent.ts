/**
 * Which lookup on this table points at the record the subgrid sits on.
 *
 * Ported near-verbatim from `pcf-chart-view/ChartView/data/parent.ts`. The
 * four-step resolver and the three-valued `rowsConfirm` are not rewritten,
 * because they are measured, and this repository has now measured them again:
 *
 * **`filtering.getFilter()` returns `null` on a subgrid whether or not it is
 * set to "Show related records only"** (2026-09-20). That is a stronger claim
 * than the one inherited — chart-view's note reads as though an *unrelated*
 * subgrid were the special case, and both cases look identical from inside the
 * control. There is no configuration a maker can change that would let the
 * control see the relationship. Only the rows can tell them apart, which is
 * what step 3 is for.
 *
 * **And the consequence has numbers.** On the probe subgrid an aggregate built
 * from the view alone counted **56** while the grid held **38**; the condition
 * `cll_customer = <the form's account>` reproduced 38 exactly. A grouped
 * subgrid without this resolver prints the wrong number directly above the
 * rows that contradict it — which is why an unresolved parent **withholds the
 * server route** rather than approximating it.
 *
 * Pure: no `context`, no dataset. Everything it needs is handed in.

 * reachable.** `null` means *the rows cannot speak*, which is not the same as
 * `false` — a row pointing somewhere else drops the candidate, while a column
 * the dataset never loaded says nothing about it either way.
 *
 * The first version asked `getValue` for that distinction and was wrong.
 * **Measured 2026-09-20 on `cll_sitevisit`:** `getValue` answers `null` for a
 * column absent from the view's layout, `null` for a column that does not
 * exist on the table at all, and `null` for one that is genuinely empty. There
 * is no `undefined` — so the branch testing for it was dead code, and every
 * unfetched candidate was being **denied** rather than left open.
 *
 * That failed in the dangerous direction. `regardingobjectid` was not in the
 * layout and read `null`, so it was denied — while the server confirmed every
 * row pointed at the form's account through it. Invert the case and the
 * *correct* lookup is the one missing from the layout: every candidate gets
 * denied, the resolver answers `unrelated`, no condition is added, and the
 * aggregate counts the whole table. The wrong number, reached through the
 * branch meant to be safe.
 *
 * So the question "was this column loaded" is asked of `dataset.columns`,
 * which is the only thing that knows, and `getValue` is asked only about
 * columns that were.
 *
 * `getValue` on a lookup is an `EntityReference`: measured as
 * `{ etn, id: { guid }, name }` — **the GUID is nested at `.id.guid`**, so
 * comparing `getValue()` against an id directly fails on every row.
