 *
 * Both go through `context.webAPI` rather than a same-origin `fetch`, which
 * keeps them inside the `WebAPI` feature a writing control already declares —
 * adopting this adds no install-time permission prompt, and that is worth a
 * release-notes line.
 *
 * The parent-candidate read (`parent.ts`'s `candidates`) cannot go this way,
 * because `context.webAPI` cannot address `EntityDefinitions`; the control
 * makes it as a same-origin fetch and hands the answer in.
